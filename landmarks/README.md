# LandMarks 

This project is built by following Apple’s SwiftUI tutorials on **Building Lists and Navigation** and **Handling User Input**.

The app displays a list of landmarks. You can tap on any landmark to see its detail view, mark it as a favorite using the star button, and filter the list to show only favorites. The favorite state updates instantly across screens because both views share the same model data.

This project demonstrates:

* Navigation using `NavigationStack`
* Dynamic lists with `List` and `ForEach`
* State management with `@State`, `@Binding`, and `@Environment`
* Real-time UI updates when data changes

The goal was to understand how SwiftUI manages data flow and keeps views in sync automatically.
